*** STARTING STEPS: 
    1. Create a new github repository on github
    2. Clone the repository locally
    3. cd into repository
    4. got the redux extension for chrome
    5. got the pesticide extension for chrome
        - both of these are a tool to help with UI/UX development
*** GETTING INTO THE PROJECT:
    1. npx create-next-app@latest
        - will prompt you to name your project
        - will go through and ask you for certain packages you might want to install
    2. cd into that directory
    3. Install required libraries
        - npm i @mui/x-data-grid @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled lucide-react numeral recharts uuid axios
        - @mui is a materials UI library
            - the package 'x-data-grid' lets us display tables.
                * SUPPLEMENTARY libraries required to use @mui/x-data-grid 
                    - @mui/material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, 
                * ADDITIONAL libraries for more features
                    - lucide-react(icon), numeral(numbers manipulation), recharts(charts), 
                * FUNCTIONALITIES libraries
                    - uuid(generate random id), axios(API calls)
    4. installing required dependencies for typescript
        - npm i -D @types/node @types/uuid @types/numeral 
        - npm - D tw-colors
    NOTE: for any version mismatch problems, just run npm i <package-name>@<version>
*** CLIENT:
    * a little bit about these files in next.js
        1. src/app/page.tsx is the first initial page that will be shown
        2. src/app.layout.tsx is the root of this project
        3. public/ is where all the assets will be saved
        4. .eslintrc.json is the eslint setup files
        5. gitignore are files to not push to github
        6. package.json is the configuration for the json file
        7. tailwind.config.tx represents the tailwind styling
        8. tsconfig.ts is the ts configuration
        
    NOTES:
        - (typing tfrace will fill a default template for a new component page)
        - hovering over a word and pressing cmd+D multiple times will select that word the number of times you press
            EX: test test test   <-- press one of these and press cmd+D
        - in order to use the onClick{() => {}} function, we must add "use client"; on top of the file
        REDUX 
         > redux is useful because it lets each user retain their state in the current session in loacalstorage
            - npm i react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit dotenv
                - @reduxjs/toolkit is a utility that simiplifies the creation of a redux store
                - dotenv is just used to store enviornment variables
            - npm i redux-persist
                - redux-persist is the library that allows user to retain their state across all sessions 
                    (i.e if they close the tab and come back their state saves)
            - /client/src/app/redux.tsx is a boiler plate redux file that can be use for any next.js projects
        > redux can also be used to create functions to change the state of items
            - /client/src/state/index.tsx  <-- also a boiler plate template
        > redux can also be used to make api calls
            - /client/src/app/state/api.tsx   <-- also a boiler plate
    1. adding in colorThemes for light/dark mode
    2. adding in a dashboard
        - this dash board is made so that it stays on the page no matter where you go
          even if you go to a different endpoint, it stays on the left side
    3. for components like the Navbar, there is a way to import it using (components) like this:
        - import Navbar from "@/app/(components)/Navbar";
        this makes it so that Navbar will not have a url impact
        this is also ignored by the router
        - very good for organizational purposes as well
    4. /client/app/state/index.tsx is where we create global functions
        - isSidebarCollapse() => boolean
            - this checks for open/close sidebar
        - isDarkMode() => boolean
            - this checks for dark/light mode
*** SERVER:
    - create a new server directory
    - npm init -y to initiate the package.json
    - npm i prisma @prisma/client@latest
        - this is used to connect to the database
    - npx prisma init
    - /server/prisma/seedData folder is where jsons for made up data is
    - npm install typescript
        - installs typescript
    - npx tsc --init
        - initialized typescript packages
    - npm i -D ts-node typescript @types/node
        - install dependencies for typescript
    - /server/prisma/seed.ts
        - this is used to initialize the database
            - when starting it deletes whats currently in it, parse the json files in seedData directory
              then it populates the database
    - After setting up the database schemas in schema.prisma update the .env file to the correct credentials
        - npx prisma generate (generate the schemas)
        - npx prisma migrate dev --name init (migrates the schema to database)
        - npm run seed (runs the seed.ts script)
    backend libraries
        - npm i express body-parser cors dotenv helmet morgan concurrently rimraf
            - express is the backend framework
            - bady-parser is used to parse request
            - cors(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a nodejs package that provides security feature implemented in 
                web browsers to restrict how resources on a web server can be requested from a different domain
            - dotenv is used for enviornment variables
            - helmet is used to secure api
            - morgan is used to log https request, useful for debugging and monitoring API requests during development and production
            - concurrently is used to run multiple commands or scripts concurrently (in parallel) in a single terminal
            - rimraf is used to help us run package to build typescript files
    dev dependencies for backend
        - npm i -D nodemon @types/cors @types/express @types/morgan
            - nodemon is used to run the live server and saves the data everytime
            - @types/cors typescript for cors
            - @types/express typescript for express
            - @types/morgan typescript for morgan
    adding a starting script in package.json
        - "build": "rimraf dist && npm tsc",
        - "start": "npm run build && node dist/index.js",
        - "dev": "npm run build && concurrently \"npx tsc -w\" \"nodemon --exec ts=node src/index.ts\""
